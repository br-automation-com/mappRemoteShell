## Introduction
This is a sample project to execute a shell command on a remote PC. The remote command is executed with a Python script that connects via OPC UA to the B&R PLC. The PLC only needs the variable structure to execute a command and some code to indicate the connection status. The sample uses a mappView visualization for demo purpose but mappView is not required to run the sample.
